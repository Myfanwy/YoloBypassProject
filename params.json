  "body": "### The Yolo Bypass Project\r\n\r\nThe Yolo Bypass is a 59,000-acre flood bypass structure that diverts floodwaters from the Sacramento River, Cache Creek and Putah Creek around the city of Sacramento and surrounding metropolitan areas. The Bypass, which occupies the extensive historic floodplain of the lowermost Sacramento River, is managed for a mix of uses, including farming, riparian and managed wetland habitat, tidal marsh habitat, upland and grassland habitat, and flood control. The Bypass is the primary floodplain of the Delta and floods in approximately 70 percent of years. Given substantial evidence over nearly fifteen years for its benefits to native fishes during flooded periods, the Bypass has become the focus of interest in managing seasonally flooded habitat in the Delta.\r\n\r\nAdult fishes such as Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), sturgeon (Ascipenser spp.), and Sacramento splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus) seasonally enter Yolo Bypass at its base, located north of Rio Vista. While splittail will spawn on the floodplain, the prevailing view is that the area acts like a giant “fish trap” for salmon and sturgeon en route to spawning areas on the upper Sacramento River; they are drawn into the floodplain’s perennial channels following late fall or early winter flows with no exit from the Bypass at its upstream end. The Fremont Weir is located at the northern tip of the Bypass, and is only connected to the Sacramento River during brief periods of high flows. Hence, the Yolo Bypass represents one of the most serious passage barriers to migratory fishes in the lower valley. \r\n\r\nHowever, beyond a general description of the timing and occurrence of large numbers of migrating Chinook salmon, sturgeon, splittail, and striped bass, remarkably little is known about what happens to these fish once they enter Yolo Bypass. In light of its importance to the Delta ecosystem, broad questions need to be answered in order to move forward with management plans. These include: how is the Bypass affecting fish positively, negatively, and/or neutrally? Which stimuli influence whether the fish choose to enter the Bypass or not, and whether they can get out if they choose? Finally, how can we manage the system to better effect?\r\n\r\nIn an effort to address these questions, UC Davis and the California Department of Water Resources are currently conducting research on the way that native fishes use the Yolo Bypass for transport and habitat. Fieldwork for this project began in February 2012, and is scheduled to continue through 2018.",
